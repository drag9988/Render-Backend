# PDF to PowerPoint Proper Conversion Fix

## Problem Identified

The PDF to PowerPoint conversion had issues with:

1. **Text Duplication**: Text appeared both in backgrounds and as editable elements
2. **Transparency Issues**: Text boxes were transparent making them hard to edit
3. **Poor Readability**: Overlapping transparent elements affected usability

## Solution Implemented

### Method 1 (Advanced) - Clean Background + Solid Text Boxes

**Background Creation:**
- Start with white background
- Extract and preserve only visual elements (images, vector graphics, shapes) 
- Completely exclude text from background reconstruction
- Fallback: Use larger merged white rectangles to completely cover text areas

**Text Box Creation:**
- Create **solid white text boxes** with light gray borders
- Position text boxes precisely at original PDF coordinates
- Use proper margins and formatting for professional appearance
- Text is **fully editable** and clearly visible

### Method 2 (Simplified) - Text Area Masking + Solid Text Boxes

**Background Processing:**
- Use PIL/ImageDraw to identify and mask text areas with white rectangles
- Preserve images and visual elements while removing text from background
- Create clean background images without text duplication

**Editable Text Creation:**
- Group text by lines for better organization
- Create solid white text boxes with proper positioning
- Each text box has:
  - White background for readability
  - Light gray border for definition
  - Proper margins and text formatting
  - Fully editable content
