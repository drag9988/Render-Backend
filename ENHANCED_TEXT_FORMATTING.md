# Enhanced PDF to PowerPoint Text Formatting & Placement

## Improvements Made

### üìê **Enhanced Text Positioning**

**Smart Coordinate Calculation:**
- Dynamic positioning with 20% width expansion and 40% height expansion for better readability
- Centered text placement within enlarged areas with slight upward adjustment
- Automatic slide margin handling (0.1" margins) to prevent text cutoff
- Intelligent bounds checking to keep all text visible

**Adaptive Sizing:**
- Minimum dimensions: 0.8" width √ó 0.25" height for readability
- Maximum constraints: 90% slide width √ó 15% slide height to prevent oversized boxes
- Dynamic sizing based on text length and importance

### üé® **Professional Text Formatting**

**Enhanced Font Management:**
- **Smart font sizing**: Adaptive scaling based on text length and context
  - Short text (< 10 chars): Full size (likely headings)
  - Medium text (10-50 chars): 95% of original
  - Long text (> 50 chars): 90% of original
- **Font range**: 9pt minimum to 28pt maximum for optimal readability
- **Professional font**: Calibri for clean, readable appearance
- **Refined text color**: Slight gray tint (RGB 20,20,20 or 25,25,25) instead of harsh black

**Advanced Text Box Styling:**
- **Generous margins**: 6pt horizontal, 3pt vertical for breathing room
- **Clean white background**: Pure white (RGB 255,255,255) for clarity
- **Subtle borders**: Light gray (RGB 210,210,210 or 225,225,225) with 0.4-0.5pt width
- **Enhanced line spacing**: 1.1-1.15x for better readability

### üß† **Intelligent Text Grouping**

**Advanced Proximity Detection:**
- **Dynamic thresholds**: Y-axis grouping based on text height (0.015 + 80% of text height)
- **Content-aware X-axis grouping**: Closer grouping (0.15) for short text, wider (0.25) for long text
- **Smart text merging**: Intelligent spacing between merged elements
- **Font property inheritance**: Larger/bolder properties preserved when merging

**Enhanced Duplicate Filtering:**
- **Precise duplicate detection**: Exact matches and meaningful substring detection
- **Content validation**: Filters out meaningless characters, short digits, whitespace
- **Line-based processing**: Maintains logical text flow and structure

### üìù **Text Organization & Flow**

**Logical Reading Order:**
- **Position-based sorting**: Top-to-bottom, left-to-right ordering
- **Line reconstruction**: Proper spacing between text spans based on gaps
- **Duplicate prevention**: Set-based tracking to avoid repeated text
- **Context preservation**: Maintains original text relationships

**Enhanced Content Processing:**
- **Meaningful text filtering**: Removes decorative elements, page numbers, artifacts
- **Line-level grouping**: Reconstructs complete sentences and paragraphs
- **Span gap analysis**: Intelligent spacing based on character spacing
- **Font consolidation**: Uses largest/most prominent formatting when merging

### üéØ **Method-Specific Enhancements**

**Method 1 (Advanced Background Separation):**
- Professional text box creation with fixed sizing for consistency
- Enhanced margin management for better visual hierarchy
- Improved text grouping with dynamic proximity thresholds

**Method 2 (Simplified Background Processing):**
- Line-based text reconstruction for better paragraph flow
- Content-length adaptive sizing for optimal appearance
- Position-sorted output for logical reading experience
